     There once was a character named Brohan who was chosen to lead a scuba diving expedition into the bermuda triangle on March 31, 2020. Today, was March 30th and he was currently boarding his flight from Chicago to Miami, where meeting before the expedition was to be held. The plane ride from Chicago to Miami goes smoothly. Brohan briefs everyone about the scuba diving expedition. The next day is his flight from Miami to the Bremuda Triangle. Brohan is at the airport getting ready to board. Despite arriving right on time, his flight gets delayed by two hours. "This is the last time I fly Delta," he says to himself. He orders a shrimp cocktail to pass the time, and eventually the plane takes off. As the plane gets closer to the Bermuda Triangle, however, a thick fog starts to fill the air.
